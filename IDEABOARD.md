Basic Site Layout:


At top of each page is a major flag header displaying the Holonet Reviews banner, along with the subheading "Organizing Canon, New and Old"
At left of each page is a navbar including the following: Home, Eras, Canon Timeline (Reviews), Cinematic Moments (Blog), About, Contact Me. The navbar DOES get affected by scrolling (unlike the social bar for Exceptional Realty)
At right is mostly clean except to display the most recent post (look up Wordpress or something like that).
At bottom is a single line of links to other sites. Below that is a footer

Backgrounds:
Every page varies, but there are some distinct similarities across all but the major pages. All paragraphs are yellow text on black background <until testing proves it to be stupid>.

-  Reviews and Cinematic Moments each have a background pertaining to their source material (the era or the movie, not specifically a book or scene). Accessing these wallpapers is not a major priority as this is flavor.

-  The homepage will obviously have a newsnet theme. need to set the tone of subjectivity with knowledge while also tapping core Star Wars themes. A picture of the vastness of space with multiple planets therein, connecting by spectral arcing blue lines with alien text above them, might just do it. This is the default background for every page to start because art takes a while to do even when motivation is high...
-  The era description page should have symbols somewhere reflecting the change of galactic control. The cover of Lost Stars could be a ~perfect~ example of what I'm looking for.
-  The timeline page should have a Jedi Archives background theme to reflect depth and information storage as well as imply wisdom in an accepting perspective.
-  The About Me page should have a simple natural background, a single planet's surface. Perhaps Tatooine, perhaps Yavin IV, perhaps Hoth.
-  The Contact Me page should have a single Holonet Transceiver as the background, more specifically and personally than the homepage.

Images:
  Novels and novellas obviously have their cover image, most likely hardcover.
  Short stories do not need an image. Think hard on how that might work.

Reviews:
  Title
    Below this but above the review is a publication date, along with where it can be found.
  Each novel or novella contains a picture of the hardcover copy. A summary accompanies, set to the right of the image.
  
  Each obviously has a review that goes in-depth into whatever I deemed worth discussing about the story and how it fits into the Star Wars canon.
  
  TLDRs at the end of the review offer For and Against (casting no judgment on the items themselves). Every story must have two of each.

Intro Page:
  Last to do.
