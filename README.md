This is a personal blog created for the dual purpose of highlighting and explicating great moments of the Star Wars saga. At present, there are three major components planned:

Current page plans include the following:
- Homepage, including a statement of purpose and clear links to all other pages. Visuals are in full view here. Possibly hand-drawn.

- The New Canon: a CU timeline tracking the novels, short stories, and comics and. This is the only spoiler-free section of the site. Every CU entry, barring the animated shows and the movies themselves, will be read, reviewed, and recommended. Each will contain title, author, an image of the book, date of publication, approximate page count and, of course, an in-depth review of how it fits into the Star Wars Universe.

- Oldies but Goodies: reviews of assorted books and games from the EU-Legends era, with discussion of how they still comply with the new and evolving canon universe.

- Scenes from the Films: detailed analyses of various scenes from the movie franchise, offering readers insight into an (often alternate) interpretation of the films.

- Animated Arcs: reviews of various Clone Wars and Rebels arcs, reflecting on how they thread the two series into the major conflicts of the Star Wars saga (CW and GCW). Extra consideration will be given to flux elements of each era - for CW, this includes the Jedi Order and major characters, while for GCW this looks at characterizations of the Empire and budding Rebellion.

- "About Me" page: my name, a short bio that touches on my relationship with Star Wars, and contact information.
